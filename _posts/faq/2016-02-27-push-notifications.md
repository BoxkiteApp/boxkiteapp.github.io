Push Notifications are unfortunately somewhat complex as they require you to configure a webhook in Buildkite that points to the boxkiteapp notifications server.

To have push notifications work, you need to configure the webhook to point to the URL https://notifications.boxkiteapp.com/receive

The webhook should use v3 of the Buildkite webhook which uses pipelines instead of projects.
